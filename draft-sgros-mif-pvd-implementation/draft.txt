                     Implementation of PvD support
               draft-sgros-dhcp-and-ipr-claim-analysis-00

Abstract

   The purpose of this draft is to document two implementations that
   tried to implement PvD architecture document.  One implementation was
   done from scratch while another is a part of an existing component
   (NetworkManager).

1.  Introduction

   TBD.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  pvd_man implementation

2.1.  Architecture

   Describe the architecture of the implementation and also make a
   reference to the MIF architecture document.

2.2.  Implementation details

   Present some key implementation details.

2.3.  Experiences gained

   Present some experience gained from the implementation.  What do you
   think was good?  What would you do differently if you were to
   implement this again.  What about language/environment, was it good,
   what was bad?

3.  NetworkManager implementation

   TBD.

4.  Server component

   Write about changes in the radvd component.

5.  Acknowledgements

   TBW.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

7.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
